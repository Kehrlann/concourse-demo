# CFP for Paris Container Day

## Abstract
Concourse is a modern, cloud-native CI/CD tool. Workers are stateless, and state is stored in external resources, e.g. git, s3, etc. Every job runs in a one-off container. It is pipeline-first, making it fast and reliable. CI brought reproducible builds, here comes reproducible CI !


## Talk description
The Concourse website states “Concourse is an open-source continuous thing-doer.” (https://concourse-ci.org). It is a great tool to implement continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines, that are both fast and reliable. It is built for the cloud, using cloud-native principles and tools, by the folks who work on Cloud Foundry (CF) at Pivotal. They leveraged the knowledge of containers they gained while building CF, and the custom CF container backend called Garden - which is runC-compatible.

In this talk, you’ll first learn the details of how Concourse works, the underlying principles and the architecture. We’ll then dive into a live demo: we’ll build a pipeline for a typical web-app from scratch, iteratively, showcasing the different principles and tools.

## Notes
_Who am I ?_ - Occasional speaker at meetups (e.g. Spring, CI/CD) - I speak at conferences and company events - I usually do live-coding, which is usually fun and interesting for the crowd - I have used Concourse extensively, and I have contributed a bit

_What I’m looking for at this conference_ - I want to inspire people, push them to experiment new tech, and challenge the current state of CI/CD - I want to meet people interested in CI/CD + containers and chat with them - And generally, I want to chat with with all kind of folks: great way to share and improve our craft and tools

I can deliver this talk either in French or in English.
